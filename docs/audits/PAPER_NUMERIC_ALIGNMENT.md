# Paper Numeric Alignment (Phase 2.5)

> **Workload naming migration (2026-07-23).** The quantities in this alignment

  corrected cross-seed → `tiebreak_fix/seeds` + `uncertainty.csv`;
  C_mixed ablation/competitive → `ablation_comp_v2`; C_hit → `c_hit`/`c_hit_v2`;
  prior-art → `baselines_v2`; aging → `aging_v2`.

## Executive summary

Phase 2 ported the **framing** and the **corrected ablation/competitive/C_hit
tables** to canonical values, but left the pre-canonical **single-instantiation
number blocks** in §2 (motivation), §3 (fundamentals), §5.1 (first-query), and
§5.2 (e2e trade-off table + prose) untouched. Those blocks still carried the
v1 `results/main` batch (baselines 529/760/1096, `2f_slru` first-query
127/128/123 µs = −76/−83/−89 %, the entire `tab:e2e-ac` body, and the
`+1248 %/+843 %` regressions). This phase replaces them with the canonical
single-instantiation batch `results/unified_v2` (baselines 523/749/1087;
`2f_slru` 108/107/102 µs = −79/−86/−91 %) and the tie-break-corrected batches
for the affected cells. Two figures (`13`, `14`) embed the v1 numbers in the
image itself and are marked **Phase 3 figure-pending**.

## Historical Phase 2.5a snapshot — SUPERSEDED by Phase 2.5b (not current guidance)

> **⚠ This table is a historical record of the Phase 2.5a `tab:e2e-ac` rebuild,
> which still included the tie-break-impact cells (C `2e_K10`, A `2e_K500`) sourced
> from `unified_v2` on a "materially identical" rationale. That rationale was
> RETRACTED in Phase 2.5b: those two rows were removed from the absolute table and
> moved to `tab:corrected-arms` (from `tiebreak_fix`). The current paper table
> lists only baseline / layers_5 / 2d / 2f_slru. Do not use the `2e_K10` / `2e_K500`
> rows below as canonical.**

Baseline A = 523 µs, C = 1087 µs. Parenthetical = paired % vs same-workload
same-batch baseline.

| Strategy | A e2e_std | A e2e_warm | C e2e_std | C e2e_warm | Cross-seed verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Baseline | 523 | 523 | 1087 | 1087 | — |
| layers_5 | 679 (+30%) | 453 (−14%) | 1352 (+24%) | 1120 (+3%) | A tie; C robust (worse) |
| 2d | 678 (+30%) | 452 (−14%) | 969 (−11%) | 735 (−32%) | A robust (−25%); C robust (−36%) |
| 2e_K10 | 694 (+33%) | 464 (−11%) | 501 (−54%) | 268 (−75%) | A robust (−36%); C robust, bimodal (−55%) |
| 2e_K500 | 1311 (+150%) | 1083 (+107%) | 915 (−16%) | 680 (−37%) | A robust (worse); C robust (−31%) |
| 2f_slru | 7552 (+1343%) | 7324 (+1300%) | 1196 (+10%) | 962 (−12%) | A robust (worse); C robust (−7%) |

**Corrected-cell note.** C `2e_K10` and A `2e_K500` are in the tie-break impact
set. Their single-instantiation values are materially unchanged by the
correction (C `2e_K10`: `unified_v2` 267.7 µs vs `tiebreak` 265.4 µs, both −75%;
A `2e_K500`: 1083 vs 1079 µs). The correction's material effect is cross-seed
(`tab:ablation`, `tab:seeds`); the verdict column carries the corrected
cross-seed direction. The table is therefore presented from the single
`unified_v2` machine-state batch to keep absolute µs same-batch-comparable.

## Programmatic verification (STEP 5)

Percentage formula (uniform): `improvement_pct = (baseline − strategy) / baseline × 100`,
paired within batch. Cross-seed values are the pipeline's per-seed paired means
+ bootstrap CI read directly from the canonical `uncertainty.csv` (not recomputed
from aggregated absolute means).

## Cross-batch table decisions

1. **`tab:e2e-ac`** — kept as a single-batch (`unified_v2`) absolute-µs table
   containing **only tie-break-unaffected strategies** (baseline, `layers_5`,
   `2d`, `2f_slru`). **[RETRACTED / superseded by Phase 2.5b — see below.]** The
   Phase 2.5a version left the two impact-set cells (C `2e_K10`, A `2e_K500`) in
   this table sourced from `unified_v2` on a "materially identical" rationale.
   That exception is **withdrawn**: canonical supersession is not waived by
   numerical closeness. Phase 2.5b removes those two rows from the `unified_v2`
   table entirely and reports them from their own corrected batch in a separate
   relative table (`tab:corrected-arms`).
2. **`tab:competitive`** — genuinely cross-batch and cannot be made single-batch
   (A/B cross-seed competitive exists only in the prior-art `results/competitive`
   batch; `baselines_v2` is single-seed with no CI). Resolution per STEP 10:
   present **relative paired improvements only** (the table already does), fix
   the one C cell that has a canonical corrected value (`2f_slru` −12→−7), and
   add a **per-source caption note** marking A/B as the prior-art batch, the C
   `2e_K10`/`2f_top14`/`2f_slru` as the corrected `ablation_comp_v2` rerun, and
   `2f_top500` as a prior-art-only arm (not re-measured in the corrected rerun).
   No absolute µs are compared across columns; the `2f_slru` anchor is not used
   as a conversion factor.

## Values changed

- Baselines 529/760/1096 → **523/749/1087** (N1–N5, N13).
- 2f_slru first-query 127/128/123 µs (−76/−83/−89 %) → **108/107/102 µs (−79/−86/−91 %)**; span −76~89 → **−79~91** (N5, N12).
- First-query ceilings/plateaus (N6–N9): A −22–26 → −27–30; A 2e_K500 −60→−64; A dump −76→−79; B −83→−86; C −38→−39; C 2e_K10 −81→−83.
- `tab:e2e-ac` full A/C body rebuilt from `unified_v2` (N14); C 2f_slru verdict −9→−7 (N15).
- §5.2 prose (N16, N18): 7134/529→7324/523; +1248→+1300; +1285→+1343; 402→415 µs; +843(B)→+879; C 2f_slru −19(−9)→−12(−7); A targeted −7~−9→−11~−14; C −73→−75.
- Reconciliation +1248 → +1300 (N20).
- `tab:competitive` C 2f_slru −12→−7 [−12,−2] (N21); per-source caption note (N22).

## Values retained intentionally

- **Abstract/contribution/conclusion/guidance** (N23): already canonical
  (−79~91, 25–30%, 0.8–7 ms, A −25→−36, C_hit −27~30); untouched.
- **`tab:ablation`, `tab:competitive` C 2e_K10/2f_top14, C_hit prose,
  layout comparison** (N24–N27): verified against source CSVs, already canonical.
- **C 2e_K10 single-inst 1071→265 −75%** (N17): reported from `tiebreak_fix` in
  `tab:corrected-arms`, labeled single-instantiation with the corrected cross-seed
  −55% in the same paragraph. *(Phase 2.5b changed the value/source from the
  earlier `1087→268` unified_v2 snapshot; the old snapshot is no longer used.)*
- **Robustness-axis numbers** (N29): not v1 artifacts, each within its own batch;
  retained. *(Open-cost is no longer a "retained" item — see below.)*
- **A/B competitive columns + 2f_top500** (N22): no canonical corrected
  replacement exists; retained under an explicit independent-batch caption note.

  as a *paired first-query reduction* chart: each bar is normalized to its own
  same-batch baseline, per-cell canonical source (`unified_v2` unaffected;
  `tiebreak_fix` for impact-set cells, hatched). No absolute µs; no v1 values.
  Caption/prose (`fig:firstq-bars`) rewritten to the relative metric; pending
  note removed.
- **`figures/14_strategy_endtoend_stacked.png`** — **regenerated** (Phase 3).
  Single-batch absolute stack (`unified_v2`) restricted to the tie-break-unaffected
  arms (baseline, layers_5, 2d, 2f_slru); corrected hotspot arms are *excluded*
  and reported in `tab:corrected-arms`. C panel correctly titled
  **C\_mixed (~50% not-found)** (no "churn-heavy"). Warm % from same-batch
  baseline: A `2f_slru` +1300%, B +879%, C −12%. Caption/prose updated; pending
  note removed.
- **`figures/17_lever_ablation.png`** — **regenerated and scoped to C_mixed**
  (Phase 3 fixed a content-stale paper copy; **Phase 3b** then removed the A/B
  panels). Now a **C_mixed-only** corrected same-batch ablation from the single
  canonical source `results/ablation_comp_v2` (2d −43%/−36%; leaf_freq
  −11%/−3% tie; leaf_rand −1%/+7% control; 2e_K10 −63%/−55%), two panels
  (first-query and warm e2e). The script no longer reads `results/ablation`, and
  the earlier "A/B pre-fix ablation is tie-break-unaffected/canonical" claim is
  **withdrawn** — the A/B levers are characterized by the cross-seed sweep
  (`tab:seeds`), not by this figure. Caption/prose updated to match.
- `18_capability_matrix.png` (qualitative), `01_page_distribution.png`
  (structural), `16_ram_pressure_sweep.png` (RAM axis) — verified byte-identical
  to the committed copies; current-valid, not regenerated.

## Validation

- **`git diff --check`** (paper): clean, no whitespace/conflict errors.
- **Brace balance**: 983 `{` / 983 `}` (escaped braces stripped), diff 0.
- **Table column counts**: `tab:e2e-ac` 5 `&` per row → 6 columns (matches the
  `\multicolumn{2}` A/C + verdict header); `tab:competitive` 4 `&` per row → 5
  columns (Arm, Footprint, A, B, C). Consistent.
- **Duplicate `\label`**: none (0).
- **Dangling `\ref`/`\eqref`**: none — all 41 references resolve to the 60
  defined labels. No new labels/refs were introduced by this phase (edits are
  numeric + caption text; the figure-note `\ref`s reuse existing labels
  `sec:eval-fq`, `tab:e2e-ac`).
- **Citations**: all 24 `\cite` keys present in `sample.bib` (0 missing).
- **LaTeX compile**: **environment limitation** — no `latexmk`/`pdflatex`/`tex`
  and no `Makefile` in the container; a full PDF build could not be run. The
  strongest available static validation (above) was performed instead. Edits are
  confined to text/number tokens and table cell bodies inside otherwise-unchanged
  environments, so no structural (compile-breaking) change was made.

## Unresolved numeric issues

1. ~~Figures 13 and 14 remain v1 internally; figure 14's C panel mistitled
   "churn-heavy"~~ → **RESOLVED in Phase 3**: figures 13, 14 (and the
   content-stale paper copy of 17) regenerated from canonical sources; C panels
   correctly labelled C\_mixed; captions/prose updated; pending notes removed.
   See the "Figure-internal stale numbers — RESOLVED in Phase 3" section above
   and [`docs/figures/FIGURE_SOURCE_MAP.md`](../figures/FIGURE_SOURCE_MAP.md).
   **No paper-visible stale figure remains.**

The three Phase 2.5a provenance blockers below are **RESOLVED in Phase 2.5b**
(see next section):

2. ~~A/B cross-seed competitive numbers have no canonical source~~ → **resolved**:
   `results/competitive` added to `RESULT_PROVENANCE.md` §4.8 as an independent,
   relative-only source, with evidence it is tie-break-unaffected for A/B.
3. ~~Open-cost 221/17/231/810 triple not reproducible~~ → **resolved**: the exact
   triple is removed from the paper; replaced with the reproducible approximate
   envelope (≈200–235 µs, common-mode).
4. ~~`tab:e2e-ac` used superseded `unified_v2` cells for C `2e_K10` / A
   `2e_K500`~~ → **resolved**: those rows removed; corrected arms reported from
   `tiebreak_fix` in `tab:corrected-arms`.

## Phase 2.5b corrections

### tab:e2e-ac atomic fix
- Removed the two impact-set rows from the `unified_v2` absolute table: the
  `2e_K10` row (its C cell is superseded) and the `2e_K500` row (its A cell is
  superseded). The table now lists only tie-break-unaffected strategies:
  **baseline, `layers_5`, `2d`, `2f_slru`** — every absolute µs from one batch.
- Added **`tab:corrected-arms`** (relative table) reporting the corrected hotspot
  arms from `results/tiebreak_fix/master_summary.csv`, each paired with its own
  same-batch baseline: A `2e_K500` (512 → 1079 µs, **+111%**), C\_mixed `2e_K10`
  (1071 → 265 µs, **−75%**). Caption forbids column-wise absolute comparison with
  `tab:e2e-ac`.
- **Retracted** the "materially identical, therefore keep in unified_v2" caption
  exception; new caption states the impact arms are reported separately so every
  µs in `tab:e2e-ac` is single-batch.

### Corrected C single-instantiation value
- Prose (§5.2) now reads **1071 → 265 µs (−75%)** sourced from `tiebreak_fix`
  (same-batch baseline 1070.68, `2e_K10` warm 265.44, paired −75.2%), replacing
  the `unified_v2`-batch snapshot `1087 → 268`. All `1087→268` current-value
  occurrences removed; the residual `268` (layout comparison `tab`/`:616`) is a
  different arm/statistic (best-warm layout comparison) and unaffected.

### A 2e_K500
- Retained as a supported point in `tab:corrected-arms` (illustrates leaf-budget
  over-provisioning: +111% regression on A), sourced from `tiebreak_fix`. Its
  first-query −64% in `tab:ceiling` is a relative reduction that reads identically
  from the corrected batch (tiebreak paired −64.3%).

### tab:seeds single-workload consistency
- The rebuilt `tab:e2e-ac` exposed that `tab:seeds`' *single-workload* column
  still held old `results/main` single-inst values (A `2d` −8, A `2e_K10` −7, A
  `layers_5` −9, B `2d` −31, C `2d` −31) that contradicted the new `unified_v2`
  table. Aligned the column to `unified_v2`: **A `2d` −14, A `2e_K10` −11, A
  `layers_5` −14, B `2d` −32, C `2d` −32** (C `2e_K10` single stays −75 from
  `tiebreak`). Narrative "single-instantiation estimate of −7%" → **−11%**. The
  *cross-seed* column is unchanged (its frequency arms C/B `2e_K10` already match
  `tiebreak` exactly; `2d`/`layers_5` cross-seed are the tie-break-unaffected
  `results/seeds` arms now blessed in §4.8).

### Open-cost
- The exact `221 µs / sd 17 / p95 231 / 810 reps` triple is **not reproducible**
  from the canonical batch. `results/unified_v2/matrix/raw.csv` (non-warmup,
  non-baseline, `open_us>0`) gives **n=1440, median 231.6, sd 9.9 (CV 4%), p95
  236.8, 5th–95th 223–237 µs** — a different count and centre; `tab:overhead`'s
  per-strategy 193–222 is from yet another batch. Statistical basis (the 810
  count) is therefore unclear. Per the "口徑不明" branch, the precise triple is
  **removed**. *(Phase 2.6 finalized the wording:* §5.2 now states the canonical
  per-rep median **≈230 µs** (`unified_v2`), and `tab:overhead`'s caption marks
  its per-strategy 193–222 µs as an **independent overhead-decomposition batch**,
  distinct from the canonical open median — the two batches are not merged into a
  single range.* No pending note remains.
  - Reproduction command: `python3` over `results/unified_v2/matrix/raw.csv`
    filtering `warmup==0 && strategy!='baseline' && open_us>0`, `statistics`
    module. Output above.

### A/B competitive provenance (RESULT_PROVENANCE.md §4.8)
- **Option A (provenance-valid).** `results/competitive` is a complete 10-seed
  batch (per-seed paired vs same-seed baseline, bootstrap 95% CI, `2f_slru`
  anchor, `sweep.log` reproducible; arms `2e_K10`, `2f_top14/28/100/500`,
  `2f_slru`). Added as a new canonical class in §4.8 for the **A/B within-batch
  competitive comparison**, relative-only, with C superseded by
  `ablation_comp_v2`. Evidence it is tie-break-unaffected for A/B: the corrected
  `tiebreak_fix` rerun reproduces A/B `2e_K10` within noise (A −38.2 vs −37.9; B
  −23.8 vs −25.2) and `2f_slru` is a ranking-free full dump. Also blessed
  `results/seeds` (tie-break-unaffected `2d`/`layers_N` arms) for the `tab:seeds`
  cross-seed column.
- **RESULT_PROVENANCE.md modified**: yes — §4.8 scope addenda only (two new
  canonical-class rows + rationale). No §4.2 freeze row altered; no CSV/result
  touched.

## Phase 2.6 corrections (residual narrative & scope cleanup)

Text/scope-only pass; no numbers rest on a superseded source after this.

1. **Workload setup** — `tab:workloads` and §7 prose corrected: C relabelled
   **C\_mixed** (mixed tail-boundary, ~50% not-found); removed the
   "recently-ingested event data / log-stream" scenario and the "full-table scan"
   scenario for B; the blanket "all draw from the full 600k range" now split
   (A/B full range; C\_mixed high-key tail, upper half beyond max id). Added
   **C\_hit** (orig-only pure-hit control) and **YD/YE** (read-latest /
   short-ranges) workload definitions.
2. **Skeleton range** — §6.2 "2d −25% to −36% across A/B/pure-hit" → **−25% to
   −30%** (A −25, B −25, C\_hit −28.5); the −36% is explicitly attributed to A's
   `2e_K10` skew bonus and C\_mixed's not-found-inflated `2d`, not the general
   skeleton.
3. **Aging** — added a **"Static-plan staleness under a moving hotspot"**
   robustness subsection from `results/aging_v2/aging_ci.csv`: under YD
   (non-stationary) the frozen frequency plan decays (**−50%→−33%** ck0→ck10)
   while the structural plan holds (**−53%→−53%**); under stationary YE both stay
   flat. The 50k-churn "no decay / recomputation unnecessary" claim is now scoped
   to a **stationary read hotspot**.
4. **Size scaling** — the pre-fix C `2e_K10` −70/−68 figures are marked
   **diagnostic only** (corrected leaf-selector magnitude not re-validated across
   sizes); the size claim now rests on the tie-break-unaffected `2d` and the
   deliver-cost trend.
5. **Recommendation** — §6.4 prose: default = **`1a` + `2d`**; `2e_K10` only with
   independently validated stable skew; moving hotspot → structural coverage /
   refresh (matching `tab:guidance`).
6. **Open cost** — §5.2 states canonical per-rep median **≈230 µs**
   (`unified_v2`); `tab:overhead` caption marks its 193–222 µs as an independent
   overhead-decomposition batch (not merged into one canonical range).
7. **Competitive caption** — notes A/B come from a pre-fix independent batch and
   the corrected rerun reproduces A/B `2e_K10` within noise (A −37.9 vs −38.2; B
   −25.2 vs −23.8); relative-only, no cross-batch absolute comparison.
8. **Novelty** — conclusion "This work is the first" → **"To our knowledge, this
   is the first … (pending fuller literature verification)"**; contribution
   "for the first time" → "to our knowledge for the first time".

## Phase 4 freeze (2026-07-12)

Paper-wide canonical freeze completed. Every quantitative claim is inventoried in
[`PAPER_CLAIM_MANIFEST.csv`](PAPER_CLAIM_MANIFEST.csv) (128 claims) and machine-
verified by [`tools/verify_paper_atomicity.py`](../../tools/verify_paper_atomicity.py)
— 111 recomputed from canonical CSVs + 17 scope-checked, **0 FAIL**. Full audit:
[`PAPER_FINAL_CANONICAL_AUDIT.md`](PAPER_FINAL_CANONICAL_AUDIT.md).

One residual atomic violation was found and fixed: `tab:seeds` B `2e_K10`
single-workload printed **−29%** (superseded unified_v2); B 2e_K10 is a tie-break
changed cell, so the atomic-correct value is **−30%** from `tiebreak_fix`. Fixed.

All figure/numeric pending items from earlier phases are now resolved; no
paper-visible stale figure or number remains.

## Phase 4.1 — Pre-OpenWhisk scope cleanup (2026-07-13)

Submission-wording and churn-provenance scoping pass. **No result, figure, CSV, or
headline number changed**; edits are `main.tex` prose plus the manifest/audit docs.

- Internal novelty TODO removed from the paper (conclusion parenthetical "(a
  positioning we flag as pending fuller literature verification)" deleted); the
  hedged "To our knowledge … first" wording is retained. The literature-review
  limitation is kept in internal audit docs only, not as a paper TODO.
- "Deployable" claims scoped to design/mechanism compatibility (Contribution 3
  title → "deployment-compatible"; intro/conclusion/Contribution-3 bodies reworded
  to "compatible with / operates within the execution constraints of FaaS
  environments"). No completed production-FaaS/OpenWhisk deployment is claimed.
- Limitation sentence added: direct FaaS-runtime validation is not in the current
  evaluation; an OpenWhisk deployment is the immediate next experimental step.
- Write-churn paragraph scoped: batch predates the trace-order-independent
  tie-break fix; the ~82–89 µs / ~580 µs levels are labeled **pre-fix diagnostic**
  (not a corrected 2e_K10 magnitude); the only retained conclusion is within-batch
  checkpoint flatness under a stationary read hotspot, distinguished from the
  moving-hotspot YD vs stationary YE aging axis. "recomputation is unnecessary for
  at least 50k write mutations" → "no plan refresh was needed to preserve the
  within-batch trend over 50k mutations." Historical values unchanged.
- Manifest regenerated (now **131 claims**): churn row re-scoped (within-batch
  flatness / pre-fix diagnostic; forbidden = corrected selector magnitude) and
  three claims added (hedged-novelty; FaaS deployment-compatibility, status = not a
  measured OpenWhisk result; OpenWhisk-pending limitation). Verifier still exits 0
  (111 recomputed + 20 scope-checked, 0 FAIL). Manifest line endings normalized to
  LF (git diff --check clean). No source value altered to force a pass.
